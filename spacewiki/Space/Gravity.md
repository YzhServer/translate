The gravity is clearly different in Space and Orbit, and it will be one of the first things you notice, though it is completely different in the two environments. Not only does gravity affect players, but it also affects projectiles and dropped items.

Items and projectiles have no gravity in Space planets and Orbit, and so will float in place.

### Orbit Zero Gravity

In Orbit, gravity does not exist, as there is no planet around. Instead, your velocity is maintained. If you fall off your station, you'll fall for a little until you slow down. If you jump upwards before exiting it, you'll fall upwards--gravity has no direction, and so you must be extra careful.

### Space Microgravity

In Space worlds with microgravity enabled, the gravity is lower than on Earth, but you will still feel the effects of it. When you jump or fall, you are still dragged back down, though considerably slower. This gravity level is configurable per world in `worlds.yml`. Higher numbers will make you fall faster, and lower numbers will make you fall slower. 

You can also jump higher in space due to this decreased gravity allowing for easier traversal of the new and harsh environments.
