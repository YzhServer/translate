# Usage

## Deploying

A Photonic Barrier can be deployed by being placed. Once placed, a 9x9x9 glass sphere will appear around the target block location for 10 seconds. This barrier is unbreakable.

Whilst a Photonic Barrier is deployed, the player will be unable to deploy another.

When a Photonic Barrier disappears, it will restore any blocks that were overridden by its structure, as well as their data (E.G., chest storage).
