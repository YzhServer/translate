A Command Sign acts as a shortcut to perform [Space commands](Commands-and-Permissions). If used, a Command Sign will perform the command written on its second line.

# Making a Sign

1. Place a Sign.

2. On the first line of the Sign, write "`[space]`", so Space knows to register the Sign as a Command Sign.

3. Write a command to be executed on the second line of the Sign. This can be any Space command; the command ran will be "/space " + whatever you write on the second line

4. Click "Done" to activate the Command Sign.
