A Suit Fabricator is a workbench that is designed to formulate Spacesuits. It can currently create the following spacesuits:
* [Voyager Armor](Voyager-Armor)
* [Rogue Armor](Rogue-Armor)
* [Explorer Armor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXPDnIlCEG8)
* [Hazmat Armor](Hazmat-Armor)

### Usage

1. Craft and place the Suit Fabricator like a regular block.
2. Right-click the Suit Fabricator to open the fabrication GUI.
3. Select the series of armor you'd like to make.
4. Start from the lowest tier of the armor set you choose - space suits are progressive, you can not just create the best one straight away.
5. Ensure you have the requirements to create the piece, place them within the GUI, then click the tick to create the piece.
6. Enjoy your new custom armor!

### Crafting

Suit Fabricators can be crafted using the following items:

* 1x Crafting Table
