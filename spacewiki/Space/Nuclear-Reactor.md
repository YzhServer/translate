A Nuclear Reactor is an [energized machine](Energy-Systems) that can be used to generate energy from [Uranium Dust](Uranium-Dust) and coolant (Supplied by [Conduits](Conduit)).

# Obtaining

## Crafting

Nuclear Reactors can be crafted using the following items:

* 4x [Uranium Dust](Uranium-Dust)
* 2x [Aluminium Alloy Ingot](Aluminium-Alloy-Ingot)
* 2x [Conduit](Conduit)
* 1x [Advanced Circuit Board](Advanced-Circuit-Board)

# Usage

## Activation

A Nuclear Reactor can be fueled by [Uranium Dust](Uranium-Dust) and coolant. Once it reaches 300 coolant, 1x [Uranium Dust](Uranium-Dust) will be consumed and create 10000 energy.

A Nuclear Reactor can store up to 2000000 units of energy, and up to 1000000 units of coolant.

## Behavior

If connected to an energized machine via [Conduits](Conduit), a Nuclear Reactor will transmit energy to it. A Nuclear Reactor must have enough coolant in order to do this, which it will receive through [Conduits](Conduit)
