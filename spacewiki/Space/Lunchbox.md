A Lunchbox is a gadget that can be used to automatically feed the player.

# Obtaining

## Crafting

Lunchboxes can be crafted using the following items:

* 1x [Titanium Can](Titanium-Can)
* 4x [Aluminium Alloy Ingot](Aluminium-Alloy-Ingot)
* 4x Iron Ingot

# Usage

## Feeding

Pressing use whilst holding a Lunchbox will open its GUI. A single slot is available for inserting food. Whilst the player is hungry, a Lunchbox will automatically feed the food to them. All foods will give only 3 Saturation, rather than their defaults.

# Calorific Values

Each valid food has its own calorific value that relates to its generic Minecraft counterpart. 100 calories are equal to half of a hunger bar.
