An Oxygen Mask is an item that can be used to breathe in anoxic environments.

# Obtaining

## Crafting

Oxygen Masks can be crafted using the following items:

* 8x Glass Pane
* 1x Iron Helmet

# Usage

## Equipping

An Oxygen Mask can be equipped by being used whilst held, or by being placed into the player's helmet slot whilst in Survival mode.

## Oxygen

Whilst equipped, an Oxygen Mask will use oxygen from [Oxygen Tanks](Oxygen-Tank) in the player's inventory to enable breathing in anoxic environments. Oxygen Tanks will lose oxygen whilst being used by an Oxygen Mask. If all Oxygen Tanks have been depleted, the player will begin suffocating.
