The advanced chainsaw is a powerful tool that can be charged in the [charging station](Charging-Station). With 1 block using 1 energy, it is capable of mass breaking logs and mangrove roots in a tree-feller like way. It is an upgrade upon the [Chainsaw](chainsaw), as it can carry more charge, break more blocks at once, and will also destroy the leaves of the tree so you do not have to wait for them to decay.
