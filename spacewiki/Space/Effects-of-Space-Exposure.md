# Suffocation



When you are not wearing your Spacesuit and leave the comfort of your home, the world is against you. Almost immediately, you will start to feel the effects of exposure to a vacuum as you will begin to bleed (Blood particles), your screen will redden, and you will be too fatigued to interact with the environment around you (E.G. Breaking blocks, opening/closing doors, etc.)

The following are ways of preventing suffocation in space:

* Being inside a room with dimensions smaller than 20x20x20. (Configurable)
* Using an [Oxygen Bubble Distributor](Oxygen-Bubble-Distributor) connected to an [Energy System](Energy-Systems).
* Wearing an [Oxygen Mask](Oxygen-Mask) whilst having [Oxygen Tanks](Oxygen-Tank) in one's inventory.
* Creating and wearing a full Spacesuit from a [Suit Fabricator](Suit-Fabricator).
* Wearing a full set of armor enchanted with [Airtight](Airtight).
