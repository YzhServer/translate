Space is quite a big plugin, with a lot of [custom items](Custom-Items). However, it is quite easy to learn even when you're starting out. This guide should help you get to your feet on your journey of exploring other planets.

### Basic Survival

* The most crucial item in Space is the [Rocket](Rocket). This allows you to switch what planet you are on easily and is portable, however, it will not help to survive without protective equipment.
* To put it simply, there are three ways of surviving in space: [Oxygen Masks](Oxygen-Mask) and [Oxygen Tanks](Oxygen-Tank), Spacesuits created within the [Suit Fabricator](Suit-Fabricator), or [machines](Energy-Systems) (Covered in "Staying for a While").

#### Oxygen Masks and Oxygen Tanks

* [Oxygen Masks](Oxygen-Mask) have infinite durability and are worn as a helmet. These by themselves have no effect, and you will still die when wearing one and exposed to a vacuum. It is, therefore, necessary to have either a Light, Medium, or Heavy Oxygen Tank in your inventory, where each tier holds progressively more oxygen.
* [Oxygen Tanks](Oxygen-Tank) are not a sustainable way of surviving unless you can create a [tank refiller](Tank-Refiller) to recharge them once depleted.

#### Spacesuits

* Space has a custom enchantment called "[Airtight](Airtight)", which will make armor pieces hold pressure when worn. The downside to this is that all armor pieces (helmet, chestplate, leggings and boots) require the enchantment.
* Fortunately, there is an easy way to get this: The [Suit Fabricator](Suit-Fabricator). The [Suit Fabricator](Suit-Fabricator) can create both Voyager and Rogue armor sets which allow for infinite breathing in space using a few easy to obtain resources.

### Staying for a While

Space has a built-in [energy and oxygen system](Energy-Systems) to allow for bases and longer-lasting habitats to be created. You'll need the following machines to get started:

* [Solar Panel](Solar-Panel), or any other form of power generation
* [Oxygen Bubble Distributor](Oxygen-Bubble-Distributor)
* [Oxygen Collector](Oxygen-Collector)

Along with a few [conduits](conduit) to transfer energy, oxygen and coolant between machines.

While the concept of creating and transferring energy and oxygen may sound a little intimidating at first, it's actually really simple. Here is a general breakdown:

* [Solar Panels](Solar-Panel) create energy during the day and store the energy internally. This can build up and never discharges unless you connect another machine using a [conduit](conduit).

* [Conduits](conduit) transfer energy, oxygen, and coolant between machines. Connecting a [Solar Panel](Solar-Panel) to another machine with conduits is as simple as placing a pathway between the two.

* Oxygen can be collected using the [Oxygen Collector](Oxygen-Collector). This converts power (Produced in the Solar Panels (Or any other power generation source)) and oxygen from surrounding leaves into oxygen, which is then stored within the machine.

* The collected oxygen can now be used by the [Oxygen Bubble Distributor](Oxygen-Bubble-Distributor) (which also requires energy). Using a few more conduits, we can modify the setup in the screenshot above to create a safe bubble of oxygen for you to survive in while there is enough power produced by the Solar Panels.
