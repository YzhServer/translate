# Usage

## Upgrading

Pressing use on a Modular Workbench will open its GUI. It is used simply by placing a Spacesuit piece within it's relevant slot in the GUI, and any valid modules will appear within the GUI to be purchased. Modules can only be purchased on armor enchanted with [Airtight](Airtight). If the module is already purchased on this armor piece, clicking it will toggle the module between enabled/disabled at no additional cost.

# Modules

Space suits can be upgraded using the [Modular Workbench](Modular-Workbench). The modules can then be toggled and controlled within the [Modular Controller](Modular-Controller)

## Helmet

### Breath Dampener

Costing $5000, Breath Dampener will stop the breathing noises within the space suit

## Leggings

### Fast Walking

Costing $7500, Fast Walking will give permanent speed
## Boots

### Advanced Projectile Resistance

Costing $200000, Advanced Projectile Resistance removes the chance of space suits "popping" on hard mode (Enabled or disabled in the `config.yml`), and makes [skeleton arrows](enhanced-skeletons) in space worlds less lethal
