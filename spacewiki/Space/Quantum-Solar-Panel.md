A Quantum Solar Panel is an [energy](Energy-Systems) source with a variable power output depending on the time of day. It can store up to 25000 units of energy to be transferred to other machines via [Conduits](Conduit). It is four times as efficient as the [Solar Panel](Solar-Panel), and twice as efficient as the [Advanced Solar Panel](Advanced-Solar-Panel).

### Crafting

Quantum Solar Panels can be crafted using the following items:

* 1x [Capacitor](Capacitor)
* 1x [Advanced Solar Panel](Advanced-Solar-Panel)
* 2x [Surge Proof Wire](Surge-Proof-Wire)
* 2x [Plastic](Plastic)
* 3x [Titanium Ingot](Titanium-Ingot)
