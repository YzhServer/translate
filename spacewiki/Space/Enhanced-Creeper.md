Creepers are much more deadly in space. Their blast yield is between 1-2x what it is on Earth, and they also deal two to three times the damage to nearby players and entities; it is much more difficult to survive a blast from them and so a hiss may be the last sound you ever hear.

This can be enabled/disabled per planet in `worlds.yml` or in the Space admin panel (`/space admin`).
