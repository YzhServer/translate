## Radioactivity

Once a Nuclear Warhead explodes, the region in which it detonated will remain radioactive for a duration of time (By default 5-minutes) with a 50-block diameter. This can be seen by thick green particles in the region which will dissipate once the region is no longer toxic.

## Counteracting

The only way to defend against a Nuclear Warhead is to diffuse it before it explodes. This is challenging, as it only counts down for 10-seconds. 

To diffuse a Nuclear Warhead in the countdown phase, the player must right-click the weapon using a [Wrench](Wrench). This will sacrifice half of the durability of the [Wrench](Wrench) but remove the warhead.
