A Titanium Pickaxe is a custom pickaxe. It has the base stats of, and can mine the same blocks as, a Golden Pickaxe.

# Obtaining

## Crafting

Titanium Pickaxes can be crafted using the following items:

* 2x [Aluminium Rod](Aluminium-Rod)
* 3x [Titanium Ingot](Titanium-Ingot)

# Usage

## Enchantments

Titanium Pickaxes come pre-enchanted with Efficiency VI and Unbreaking X. Removing the enchantments via a Grindstone will change the stats to those of a Golden Pickaxe.
