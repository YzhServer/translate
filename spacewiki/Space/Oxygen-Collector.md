An Oxygen Collector is an [energized machine](Energy-Systems) that can be used to collect oxygen from nearby leaves, provided it is supplied with energy.

# Obtaining

## Crafting

Oxygen Collectors can be crafted using the following items:

* 4x [Aluminium Alloy Ingot](Aluminium-Alloy-Ingot)
* 4x Oak Leaves
* 1x [Surge-Proof Wire](Surge-Proof-Wire)

# Usage

## Activation

An Oxygen Collector can be activated by receiving energy from [Conduits](Conduit).

An Oxygen Collector can store up to 16000 units of energy, and up to 8000 units of oxygen.

## Behavior

Whilst activated, an Oxygen Collector will collect oxygen from leaves within a distance of 2 blocks.

An Oxygen Collector requires 2-16 leaves in order to produce oxygen. More leaves will increase the efficiency of an Oxygen Collector.

Oxygen from an Oxygen Collector can be transmitted to machines via [Conduits](Conduit). Machines will only receive oxygen if they require it to function.
