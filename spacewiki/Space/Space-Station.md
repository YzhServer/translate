A Space Station is an experience like no other. Without a planet to fall down to, velocity is maintained by items and the player, allowing you to jump, or fall high, or even hover. A Space Station can contain a few basic items such as a [Wrench](Wrench), [Oxygen Mask](Oxygen-Mask), and an [Oxygen Tank](Oxygen-Tank). However, this is not guaranteed. They can be accessed using [`/space station`](Commands) or by using a [Rocket](Rocket).

Projectiles and Jetpacks are extremely helpful for navigation in Space Stations and could save your life if you fall off.

Provided `Safe-Orbit` is enabled for the world in `worlds.yml`, falling out of a Space Station world will provide no void damage.

Items will float in orbit freely.

### How to use

Obtaining a Space Station is simple: either use a [Rocket](Rocket) or `/space station` to warp to your Space Station. There is no cooldown, however, each player can only have one Space Station.
