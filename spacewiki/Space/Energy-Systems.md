Most Space machines require energy to operate. Space contains an energy system for linking together energy sources, [Conduits](Conduit), and [machines](https://github.com/Z4OLLIEZ4/Space/wiki/Custom-Items#Energy-Systems).

# Usage

To break down energy into a few simple steps:
1. Place down a machine that outputs power.
2. Place down the machine you'd like to power.
3. Link together the machine and the power source using [Conduits](Conduit).

Some machines, such as the [Oxygen Collector](Oxygen-Collector), take in this energy and output oxygen when surrounded by leaves. This is stored within the machine and is completely useless unless it is transferred to a machine such as the [Oxygen Bubble Distributor](Oxygen-Bubble-Distributor). Thankfully, this is made simple as conduits work as both a wire and a pipe.

Therefore, the same process goes for transferring oxygen:
1. Place down a machine that outputs oxygen ([Oxygen Collector](Oxygen-Collector)).
2. Place down a machine that accepts oxygen ([Oxygen Bubble Distributor](Oxygen-Bubble-Distributor)).
3. Link together the two machines using [Conduits](Conduit).

The exact same system is in place for transferring coolant.

# Additional Information

* [Conduits](Conduit) work across infinite distances instantly.
* A [Wrench](Wrench) is extremely useful in Energy Systems. It can break machines and retain their stored oxygen, energy and coolant, or, when right-clicked on a [Conduit](Conduit), will tell you the total amount of oxygen, energy and coolant within the system.
