Titanium gauntlets are a powerful, handheld weapon. While a living entity is nearby, and the gauntlet is equipped in either the primary or off-hand, the player can right-click to send a repulsive beam to shoot the entity away from them. There is no cooldown to this ability, and it can be charged in the [charging station](Charging-station).
