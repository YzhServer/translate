An Atomiser is a workbench machine that can be used to deconstruct [Space items](Custom-Items) into their crafting components. Not all space items can be atomised, and some items require multiple inputs to produce one output.

# Obtaining

## Crafting

Atomisers can be crafted using the following items:

* 1x [Circuit Board](Circuit-Board)
* 2x [Surge-Proof Wire](Surge-Proof-Wire)
* 2x [Aluminium Alloy Ingot](Aluminium-Alloy-Ingot)
* 4x [Titanium Ingot](Titanium-Ingot)

# Usage

## Deconstructing

Pressing use on an Atomiser will open its GUI. Items can be placed into the left slot, which will produce the shaped recipe of the item in the right slots. The item that is being deconstructed will only disappear once one of the components is taken.

For recipes that create multiple of an item, that number of items must be placed in the left slot in order to be deconstructed.
