A Rocket is the primary mode of transportation in Space as it is portable and allows for quick and easy transport planets and [Space Stations](Space-Station). They are infinitely reusable.

### Usage

When you first travel to a new planet, you'll teleport to the spawn of that planet. However, you can go out and explore wherever you like, and then return to Earth using your Rocket. When you return, you'll be exactly where you set off from, as they remember the last coordinates they launched from.

1. Place your Rocket by right-clicking the floor where you'd like it to be.
2. Right-click the rocket to open up the GUI, and also sit inside ready for launch.
3. Select the planet which you'd like to teleport to.
4. Sit in the Rocket (Do not leave it) throughout the countdown, and then until it reaches peak altitude.
5. You will then teleport to your destination
6. Have fun exploring the galaxy!
