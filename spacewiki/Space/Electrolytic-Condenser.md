An Electrolytic Condenser is an [energized machine](Energy-Systems) that can be used to generate coolant from water source blocks above it. It is used in tandem with energy to fill [Coolant Cells](Coolant-Cell).

# Obtaining

## Crafting

An Electrolytic Condenser can be crafted using the following items:

* 4x [Reinforced Aluminium Alloy Ingot](Reinforced-Aluminium-Alloy-Ingot)
* 2x [Plastic](Plastic)
* 1x [Conduit](Conduit)
* 1x [Coolant Unit](Coolant-Unit)
* 1x Hopper

# Usage

## Activation

When supplied with energy VIA [Conduits](Conduit), the Electrolytic Condenser will drain energy from a valid water source above it to generate coolant. Provided a [Coolant Cell](Coolant-Cell) is within, it will fill the cell with coolant which can be used in a [Coolant Unit](Coolant-Unit)

An Electrolytic Condenser can store up to 12000 units of energy, and up to 12000 units of coolant.

## Behavior

An Electrolytic Condenser will generate coolant, but inputs energy and requires a water source block placed above in order to do so.
