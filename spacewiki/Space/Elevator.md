An Elevator is a machine that can be used to move players vertically.

Elevators can be dyed any color by right-clicking them with the relevant dye.

Elevators can be crafted using the following items:

* 2x [Conduit](Conduit)
* 2x Iron Ingot

# Usage

## Positioning

By itself, an Elevator will do nothing. At least one other Elevator must be placed with the same X and Z coordinates. Elevators will connect to other Elevators within a vertical range of 16 blocks.

## Elevation

Jumping whilst on an Elevator will teleport the player to the next available Elevator that is above the first.

Sneaking whilst on an Elevator will teleport the player to the next available Elevator that is below the first.
