A Wrench is a simple but useful tool with four purposes:

1. Right-clicking a [conduit](conduit) with a wrench will display the total system oxygen, energy and coolant
2. Breaking a machine using a wrench will make the machine retain its current oxygen, energy and coolant. This is helpful for energy transfer between two separate locations or moving bases/machines.
3. Diffusing a [nuclear warhead](nuclear-warhead) by right-clicking (Will sacrifice half of it's durability to do so)
4. Shift + right-clicking a [conduit](conduit) with a wrench will visualise the entire energy network
